Archie is a Discord.py bot developed for the Arc Community Discord server's Arc Windows Buddy Day (January 23, 2024). On this day, people who were allowed into the beta for Arc for Windows could invite 5 people to skip the waitlist for Arc for Windows. This bot was used to lock threads once someone looking for an invite was invited, or if someone who had invites to give out finished their invites.

## Features
-  Locking threads: If a thread is unlocked, lock it using the command `/lock`. If the user executing the command is not the creator of the thread or does not have the manage thread permissions, it asks the owner to lock it by clicking a button.
-  Unlocking threads: If a thread is locked, unlock it using the thread's ID or link.

# Self Hosting:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/y-u-s-u-f/Archie/`
2. Add your token to the bottom of `main.py`.
